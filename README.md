# InterPlanetary Storage Exchange (IPSE)

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: InterPlanetary Storage Exchange (IPSE)

**Project Description**: IPSE is a decentralized storage marketplace that enables users to list their storage resources and allows others to purchase these resources. It addresses the challenges of high on-chain data storage costs, lack of rewards for data owners, GDPR compliance, and scalability issues by offering a scalable, cost-effective, and compliant platform.

## Why IPSE?

- **Innovative Solution**: IPSE leverages blockchain technology to create a global marketplace for storage resources, making it possible to store data on-chain without the traditional high costs.
- **Incentivized Data Owners**: By rewarding data owners for their contributions, IPSE encourages a more active and engaged community in the decentralized storage ecosystem.
- **GDPR Compliance**: IPSE's regional subnets ensure compliance with GDPR regulations, providing a secure and privacy-preserving environment for users.
